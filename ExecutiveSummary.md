##Problem

Organizations often seek to save valuable resources like time and money by avoiding manually building entire systems, and instead utilizing already existing source code packages within their company. However, using external source carries an inherit risk in the form of software vulnerabilities. Highly vulnerable software often can pose much more of a risk to an organization than a benefit, but soundly coded source on the other hand provides huge benefits with little risk. Our organization is seeking to standardize the process of implementing external code to ensure that only code with appropriate levels of vulnerability are allowed to be used in our company.

##Solution

To alleviate the risks associated with the input of external source, this project has produced a process in which external code can be checked against existing databases to find any existing known vulnerabilities, and these vulnerabilities can be scored and checked against policy to see if they are acceptable. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) hosts a large, current database of such vulnerabilities, giving our organization easy and quick access to this informaiton. A corporate manager can review project risks against polcicy and inform the organization and the developers whether or not the code is acceptable.
