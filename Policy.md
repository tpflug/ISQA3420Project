https://www.first.org/cvss/cvss-v30-examples_v1.1.pdf

In short, the policy is what we would apply to the results
	This can be ‘made up’ by you but know where it is going to apply
	This will include context, thresholds, and response

###Context
What is the context that this policy would apply? 
###Threshold
What are the minimum values (CVE) that need to be passed? 
###Response
If this doesn’t pass, what do you do?
