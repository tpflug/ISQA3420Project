#Sample Policy Documents

###Policy 1

####Context

This policy applies for projects related to 

Our company plans to utilize files and/or packages of source code written outside of the organzation. As such, established policies are in place which dictate the allowable level of vulnerabilities in external code. For any source brought into the organization, the company follows set procedures for researching any existing known vulnerabilities related to the source, scoring the impact of those vulnerabilities, and determining whether or not the code is appropriate for use in our organization. The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is the tool in place to determine the numerical score of CVE risks. The CVSS is defined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). More specific details regarding the scoring standards used by CVSS can be found at https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document and https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm.

####Threshold
What are the minimum values (CVE) that need to be passed? 
The following table details the scoring standards for assessing vulnerability severity and acceptability of external code.

| CVEE Score    | Risk Severity | Response  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| ---------:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned |           |
| col 2 is      | centered      |           |
