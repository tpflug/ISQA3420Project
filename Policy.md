#Sample Policy Documents
---
This policy utilitizes the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), a standard tool for determining a numerical score of CVE risks. The CVSS is defined by NIST. More specific details regarding the scoring standards used by CVSS can be found at https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document and https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm.

###Policy 1

####Context

Our company plans to utilize files and/or packages of source code written outside of the organzation. As such, established policies are in place which dictate the allowable level of vulnerabilities in external code. Depending on the context within our organization that the external code stands to affect, these policies apply differently and require varying responses. The following policy will be applied when examining the risks attached to code involved in the backend processes for projects in the organization. That is, this policy applies to packages of code which have lower levels of exposure and criticality within our system, or are otherwise less often utilized by the system. 

####Threshold

The following table details the scoring standards for assessing vulnerability severity and acceptability of external code related to performing backend funcitons within our organization.

| CVEE Rating   | Score Threshold | Pass/Fail  |
| ------------- |:-------------:|:---------:|
| None      | 0.0      | Pass |
| Low       | 0.1-3.9  | Pass |
| Medium    | 4.0-6.9  | Pass |
| High      | 7.0-8.9  | Fail |
| Critical  | 9.0-10.0 | Fail |

####Response
If this doesnâ€™t pass, what do you do?

###Policy 2

####Context 

This policy applies to external source which may be implemented in order to handle client sales, customer data, and transaction based processes within our system. This category of information has a higher exposure level, as well as more sensitive informaiton. As such, the tolerable level of vulnerabilities is more strict in this policy, so it is more likely that the organization will reject the use of code in this context if it is deemed to be too much of a risk to implement. 

####Threshold

| CVEE Rating   | Score Threshold | Pass/Fail  |
| ------------- |:-------------:|:---------:|
| None      | 0.0      | Pass |
| Low       | 0.1-2.9  | Pass |
| Medium    | 3.0-5.9  | Pass |
| High      | 6.0-7.9  | Fail |
| Critical  | 8.0-10.0 | Fail |

####Response
